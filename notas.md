Therefore, the actual sequence of events is:

The menu function is called, and the script enters the loop, waiting for user input.
The setTimeout(decirhola, 2000); schedules the decirhola function to be executed after 2 seconds.
However, because the menu function's loop is blocking (waiting for user input), the setTimeout callback will not execute until the blocking operation (menu interaction) completes.
This means that:

If the user is still interacting with the menu after 2 seconds, the decirhola function won't run until after the menu loop exits.
Once the user exits the menu (by choosing option 3), the decirhola function will then execute (printing "Hola" to the console), provided 2 seconds have elapsed since setTimeout was called.
Summary
The correct interpretation of the code's behavior is:

The menu function runs and blocks further execution until the user exits the menu.
setTimeout(decirhola, 2000); schedules decirhola to run after 2 seconds, but it will actually execute only after the menu interaction is complete.
